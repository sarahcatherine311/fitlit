# FitLit

## Abstract
This web application was focused on creating a dashboard with easy to read information about users daily habits such as sleep, hydration, and activity. Users are able to see the latest activity data, goals, and milestones.

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/tdmburr/fitlit).
In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key.
Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.

Install the library dependencies:

Run: ```npm install```
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

## Reflections: 
We completed this project as part of our first two-part group project, where we will be working together over an extended amount of time. We are currently in week two of Module two for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of seven days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-2/fitlit-part-one-agile.html). This project allowed us to continue growing our cooperative learning skills, teammwork, communication, and our software developer skills. 

## Technologies Used:
